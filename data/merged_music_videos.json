Drawing circles like I've happened Will I find myself before I lose my mind? Against a million reasons I still find myself believing If I hold my breath one day I'll start to fight Would I get even be mine? Oh, it's poking at my thoughts Would you just tell me what you want? Hard to offer honest thoughts Face to face with the lonely mind And what if nothing ever happened? Drawing circles like I've happened Will I find myself before I lose my mind? Against a million reasons I still find myself believing If I hold my breath one day I'll start to fight Would I get even be mine? Drawing and giving take was it all the waste? If they don't know my name, tell myself Just one more day, tell it all grace Tell me how something always stops There's same news in a lost cause To walk in different ways Tell myself just one more day, tell it all grace And what if nothing ever happened? Drawing circles like I've happened? Will I find myself before I lose my mind? Against a million reasons I still find myself believing If I hold my breath one day I'll start to fight Would I get even be mine? Drawing circles like I've happened Will I find myself believing If I hold my breath one day I'll start to fight Would I get even be mine? Drawing circles like I've happened Drawing circles like I've happened",

And that's when you said we're over, so if you feel a little bit looser, but baby I'm on best, needin' your closure. I know heart feelings for you now, nothing left to cry about. Said you couldn't take the club, but still you're coming back around. That's great, man, this game is so cool. Don't mistake me for a fool, keep me running, so now it was cool. Gives like this, we'll see if you're cool. But I don't wanna talk now, but baby I'm, baby I'm, baby. I'm so glad you left me now, and such's really working out. And you want to talk now, but baby I'm, baby I'm, baby I'm, baby I'm, baby closer. I've never been treated any colder than the night when you said we're over. So if you feel a little bit looser, but baby I'm on best, needin' your closure. I can only get you when I'm down and talk, I've nothing come and come, but ain't nobody laughing. And ain't super fit, and you appear when I was winning, won't me now, but it ain't gonna happen. To the unicycle, turn it to my new recital, no, the screamer name I got my noddle. And now you're back to travel, tryna pick up a new title, but what happened, baby that was final. I'm tears of a rough needin' cause it, it's not even long past so bad. So if you're lookin' for it, show it, mine's not out for offer. I've never been treated any colder than the night when you said we're over.

Are you a takeer? Can you hear my silent cries? I give my all but you just take. And never sympathize. Every time you need a hand. I'm the one who understands. Yet you act like it's downright. Throwing shade day and night. I stood by you all this time. Yet you play me like a fine. Give it more with no time. That's so sad, but I learn. Do it take good. Do you even realize?

You put up your guard, but you can't go back You're waking up more, we're so you could have It's time I use it, hope you're quick Our compasses are still through over You're too little to wait They'll never be the same You put up your guard, but you can't go back You're waking up more, we're so you could have You put up your guard, but you can't go back You're waking up more, we're so you could have It's time I use it, hope you're quick Our compasses are still through over And over and over and over And over and over and over You pray like hell and then you got it But you only want something after you've lost it",

One dream, once you drop everything for me. I feel so exhausted, have I finally lost it? Guess that time can tell the only story. This might be my only chance, so I'm taking my deep breath. Can't see you with another man, or if I'm holding out my hands. And I don't get no other plans. Darling, no armors, come fast. And they see love comes once in a lifetime. You're just got to know the right signs. So glad I didn't give up, thought made me how it's in enough. Things don't always work out in the hell. If this is really my last hope, giving you everything I know. So heaven's gonna be in my last extend. Star makes getting kinda nice, it's maybe just two caches.

Kiss me like nobody's watching us Too close to alone in the middle of a crowded room. I love Can't we pretend that we're invisible? For all I can't wear the only ones holding each other in the middle of a crowded room. I love Just to us So here's a toss at the moment To be in young and alive Don't need to know where we're going It'll all make sense when we arrive Dance with me under the eard Until the sun starts to rise It doesn't matter where we are It's all those I got you here by my side And won't you disappear with me tonight So can't we pretend that we're invisible?

For all I can't wear the only ones holding each other in the middle of a crowded room. I love Just to us For all I can't wear the only ones holding each other in the middle of a crowded room.

I be feeling like goodness gracious and as good gracious. Head in the clouds every day, I get a facelift back to the basics, ran on a basis. Me and all my teachers on a first name basis like Matthew Mark Luke, John, Ben through all the songs. I've been doing this so long I can't do it wrong. If I had to, still reading banter. You can't cancel God's plans even if I'm cancer. But I'm still here, rhyming like I'm Paul Simon. Here for a good time and a long time. The old me, who's he? I got Alzheimer's, love joy, peace, patience, and more kindness. You ain't the king, you just smoking, that's just your highness. Forget the watch on the wrist, my cator timeless. You were deemed there renew, you're the Lord's finest. Still speak the king's speech when I tore a china. Am I in a meek of face me? They could take my body but my soul long safety. Top five, I don't care what they placed me. I was eating top ramen in my mama basement. Now I got the top back, skating on a pavement. Trap Marvin Samp, cause I never would have made it. And God took my blood, sweatin' tears like some cake mix. Put me in a fire, so refined you could taste it. Mmm, mmm, I like that. Taste the sea of the Lord is good, baby. Cause listen, I really like that. I ain't got a right that. Used to rap for Satan, heard it, devil won his mic back. Prowley won his life back. Prowley won his rice back. He heard he was a soldier but he'll never get it straights back. I don't bark, I bite back. Uncle told me when I would get bullied better, fight back. I'ma go out swing until I die, I see Christ back. Used to follow yellow bricks, I'm on the right path. I got the right man. Get it? Jesus plus nothing, that's the right man. I'm freestylein' on while it. But my time is expiring. Reconstruction on the way. Stay torn. Yeah.",

They can't imagine me not trying to make myself look bigger all for this Kendrick mention I can't imagine his position before I got on my mission. I was a party victim I bought the party favors. I used my trauma my single mama then justify comments to pay the devil's wages They probably went over their heads basically what I said is I was government fed bread for doing time and affairs But Jesus bled instead of putting dense in the head he turned his my cup run that over with nonsense They hearts grow colder. They love to do evil. They burn they conscience. I want the dealers head who gave my cousin fettin all Labels exploiting rap and addicts man. I'm sick of y'all my daddy ram will come to crisp my uncle's pyru Stuck in the middle of this madness. What's your I choose? I should be choosing to eat Howard and Hampton I love the people that I ran with but look at the damage you want me put you on But I know you still with the scamming a crooked doctor took advantage and hooked me on Xanix is kill is sitting in a cell for taking somebody Innocent and they don't even feel no remorse the worst ignorance But when I take a look in the mirror the blood of your riots on my hands cuz I'm that killer who had bad sheba in his quarters I'm that who let Eve taste the fruit of death. I'm dead center. I deserve death along with all these ligus and hypocrites Fake tough rappers who fabricate they predict amiss fake deep cool pushing who don't own the people telling folks that my god Ain't real. That's real. Eve I wonder what the craze would do Hopefully seek the hand of God and tell them that he's incapable But truthfully, I'm nobody to judge my good deeds are like some period blood stains on a dirty rug All that I can offer them is Jesus love. I know what sound foolish to many like really? That's all you got for us. Yeah, the cross is foolish to the perishing the world. I'll call me weak in the saints I'll say I am there or some I walk the valleys full of evil. I'm aware of it I can't condemn the world and burn all other heretics Love his patience. So I'm trusting in and never to and Christ. They watch the party die. He died instead of the head of the head of the head",

You were lying when you said that you were trying to work things out. But now I'm broken down. Went to battle for you always. Fought for you on your worst days. Then you told me that you don't love me no more. You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose. All I ever wanted was to be loved by you. I led you back in and I gave you a second chance. And like I can't blame all the Clevver's God. So I came churning down. I know you're lies. I got too much pride to let that happen again. So this is where it ends. Had to bury all your memories.

She was everything I needed more. Never breathed the breath so pure. Didn't know that breath would be my last. She'll save your soul then give you hell. She'll make me God in the devil himself.

Happy birth, baby, haven't seen you in a while. Never really thought about the things we left unsuttle. Oh. Sometimes I look up words, I know that there's a plan. I've been to certain old need to have my dreams ripped away. Happy birth, baby, haven't seen you in a while. My secrets at 17 are gone just like your smile. Happy birth, baby, haven't seen you in a while. Never really thought about the things we left unsuttle. I'll brush it off and I'll carry on. We'll think of it tomorrow, it's fine. I miss who I was back then and you're one of the reasons why. But I'd be birthday, baby, can't believe you're out there. You'll always keep a part of me, it's always my reminder.",

    "lyrics": " I've been told I'm lazy, I've been told I'm crazy, I feel like I may be all of the above I've been caught on waste, well never to my face, I've been told I'm great and I'll never be enough. Yeah, I just woke up hoping that this would be a much better day. I just spent the morning up trying to learn how to meditate, anything. That could get me right back into this old bed of state, but that ain't working maybe I just gotta go get away, no, that ain't it, no that's not what I needed. It's where I knew this before, so I do I keep on repeating, expecting different results like something's going to change. Guess I did this to myself, I think I'm going insane. Okay, look, once I tell them me to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, other side, tell them me stop. Once I tell them me to focus on the work and the job of the side, keep telling me not, keep telling me, ah, need a second just to breathe, need a minute just to rest, but part of me telling me, I cannot do that, I'll get all the sleep that I need when I'm done. Feeling like I'm at the edge, tiptoeing on the ledge, quit throwing in the tower, that's not how I'm going out right now, not yet, but I confess I've been upset every morning, I've been laying in bed, it's going to do feet, knowing it means nothing to me, I'm not my best. I've been told I'm lazy, I've been told I'm crazy, I feel like I'm maybe all of the above, I've been called a waste, well, never to my face, hell, I've been told I'm great and I'll never be enough. I heard I'm successful, I just let them guess though, they ask is it stressful doing what you love, I feel like I'm still lost, maybe that's the real job, I pray that you're real, God and everything above, I was counting mistakes, rounding up to be safe, down and out, but like round about, so I went back around, now we stray, I went back around like 20 times, like 22, like 29, thought I cracked the code, like a dozen times, hope it pans out, like a sunny side, but I know all the circles have a roll, flower style when the showers drive, but that doesn't mean they didn't grow, even if it doesn't show, even if I never know, I see stars in the darkest nights, so I'll find light in this hole. I've been told I'm lazy, I've been told I'm crazy, I feel like I'm maybe all of the above, I've been called a waste, well, never to my face, hell, I've been told I'm great and I'll never be enough, I heard I'm successful, I just let them guess though, they ask is it stressful doing what you love, I feel like I'm still lost, maybe that's the real job, I pray that you're real, God and everything above.",
